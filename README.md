# Trillo - Hotel Booking Interface

Trillo is a hotel booking interface application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It serves as a user-friendly platform for browsing and selecting hotels, but it is a static, non-responsive prototype, created to showcase front-end design skills.

## Features:
- A clean and modern user interface for hotel selection.
- Display of hotel details including images and descriptions.
- Simple navigation between hotel listings.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML** for the structure and content of the app.
- **CSS** for styling the layout, colors, and fonts and overall design.
- **JavaScript** for basic interactivity (the app is static for now).

## How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser to view the interface.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trillo.git
cd trillo
open index.html
